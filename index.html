  <h1>Social Media Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    This application is intended for academic, personal, or internal business use only. It does not collect, store, or share any personal user data.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Access</h2>
  <p>
    The application may access publicly available content from Facebook or Instagram Pages that the user manages, such as post messages, engagement metrics (likes and comments), and timestamps. This access is strictly limited to authorized users and approved permissions. No private profile or individual user data is accessed.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Use</h2>
  <p>
    All accessed data is used solely for academic or business insight purposes. The application does not store this data persistently, nor is it shared with third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    As no personal data is stored, there is generally no data to delete. However, if you believe your data was accessed or collected in error and would like to request removal, please contact the developer at:
